## ENHANce
ENHANce is an application designed to improve manual blood pressure logging with an app based on OCR technology, replacing traditional paper logged patient blood pressure with a online database storage system and a modern and simplistic mobile app.

## Features
### Login System
To facilitate clinic staff, ENHANce includes a login page synced with an online database of users.
### Patient Searching 
In order to organise and help clinics manage the large amount of patients, a simple patient search with a simple textbox searches the database based on their ID.
### Patient Profiles and Visits
Each individual patient have records specific to them, along with every visit and scan.
### OCR Technology
Using industry-standard OCR scanning technology, the app allows clinics to scan paper records and implements them into the app to swiftly record each relevant record with high accuracy.
### Patient History
All patient scan history is stored into the database, with Average Home BP, Clinic BP, and simple recommendations for the patient to improve their blood pressure.
### Dashboard
Every patient has a dashboard native to their individual records, allowing doctors and clinics to see the progress of the patient, and print out physical graphs for their own reference.
### Localisation 
In order to improve the readability and accessibility of the app, the app offers different languages other than English.
